* Cambridge Analytica
- Company paid Facebook users to take surveys
- Based on the survey and their facebook likes, they could predict:
  - sexual orientation
  - ethnicity
  - religious and political views
  - personality traits
  - intelligence
  - happiness
  - use of addictive substances
  - parental separation
  - age
  - gender
- They used this data to influence the 2016 election
- Facebook insists there was no technical failure in their security procedures
- Scary implications for Facebook's privacy policies

* Google Project Zero
- Zero-day :: a vulnerability that developers have zero days to prepare for

- Project Zero searches for vulnerabilities in other companies' software
- If they find it, they notify the company and give them 90 days to fix it
  before releasing the bug to the public
- Is this reasonable?
  - Yes. In almost every situation it is harder to find the
    vulnerability than to actually fix it

* Law vs. Morality
- What is legal is not necessarily moral
- What is illegal is not necessarily immoral
- Westboro Baptist Church
  - Their protests are legal but immoral
- Edward Snowden
  - His acts were illegal but not necessarily immoral

* Value Sensitive Design
** Defining Success
- One of the most important parts of value sensitive design is finding the right
  definintion of "success" for your project
- Projects with bad success definitions may succees on their own terms, but be
  very bad in other respects
- What is the success definition of cybersecurity?
  - Security, but what exactly does this mean?
  - Maximum security is not always possible or desirable
** Why is cybersecurity important?
- Value :: something that is important, bears on how we ought to live
- Intrinsic value :: something that is valuable for its own sake
- Instrumental value :: something that is valuable only as a means for getting
  something else
- Cybsersecurity is instrumentally valuable
** Stakeholders in Cybersecurity
- Direct stakeholders :: people who directly use a technology
- Indirect stakeholders :: people who do not directly use a technology but are
  affected by its use
** Is the free market a solution for security?
- No.
- Power assymetry - companies have more power than users in security
- Information assymetry - companies have more information on security than users
- Users can't reasonably make the right decisions on which services to use
** Companies may have a duty to protect their users' security
- Possible justification for project zero
** Professional role obligations
- Are penetration testers morally/legally obligated to report legal violations
  they may find while investigating a company?
  - No easy answer, consider the analogy of doctors and their patients
