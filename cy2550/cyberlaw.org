#+TITLE: Cyberlaw

* Learning outcomes:
Cryptography, passwords, and authentication
- Password cracking skills
Vulnerabilites and exploits
- Practice performing live exploits

* Cybersecurity laws
- Outdated
- Broad
- Vague
- Legal and ethical are not the same

* How are cybercriminals prosecuted?
Pyotr Levashov, aka Severa
- Prolific spammer
- Operator of many botnets
- Arrested in Barcelona in 2017
- Extradited to the US in 2018
- Charged with:
  - Causing intentional damage to a protected computer
  - Accessing protected computers in furtherance of fraud
  - Threatening to damage a protected computer
- Obvious criminal charged appropriately

Marcus Hutchins, aka malwaretech
- Anti-malware researcher
- Accidentally stopped the WannaCry malware outbreak by activating hidden killswitch
- Arrested and accused of writing, selling, and possible operating the Kronos
  banking trojan
- Charged with:
  - Conspiracy
  - Intentionaly damage to a protected computer
  - Illegal wiretapping
- Black hat hacker "reformed" to get reduced sentence

* Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986
- Written in response to the movie WarGames
- Prohibits access to a protected computer without authorization or in excess of authorization
** CFAA Details
- A protected computer is any computer used in or affecting interstate or
  foreign commerce or communication
  - Essentially every computer connected to the internet
- Criminal offenses
  - Unauthorized access to information on a protected computer
  - Leveraging unauthorized access to commit fraud for something of value worth
    > $5000
  - Causing damage or loss to a protected computer
    - Could just be disabling it or knocking it offline
  - Threatening to cause damage to or steal information from a protected
    computer without authorization
** Notable CFAA Prosecutions
- Robert Morris for releasing the Morris worm
  - Purpose was to prove a vulnerability, but it spread to almost every device
    on the internet
- US v. Collins: against members of Anonymous for DDoSing Paypal
- Albert Gonzalez for the TJX hack
- Numberous cybercriminals, such as Severa
** How does the CFAA impact cybersecurity researchers
The CFAA doesn't state what "authorized use" means
- Who decides what computers may be accessed or are "protected"
- Who decides how a computer may be accessed
Different circuit courts have different interpretations
** Infamous CFAA Prosecutions
- US v. Lori Drew: Drew created a fake MySpace account and used it to harass a
  young girl, who later committed suicide
  - Drew charged under CFAA for violation MySpace's ToS
  - ToS said fake accounts were unauthorized
  - Drew was eventually fully acquitted
- US v Nosal: Nosal stole a database from his former employer using credentials
  borrowed from a current employee
  - Account sharing violated the computer use policy for the corporate networka
- Aaron Swartz
  - Developer and internet activist
  - Co-developer of RSS and Markdown
  - Crawled research papers from JSTOR by breaking into MIT wiring closet
  - JSTOR and MIT didn't press charges, but US charged him with 13 counts under
    the CFAA, giving him 35 years in prison and a 1M fine
  - He committed suicide
** Access Versus Use
- CFAA criminalizes access violations, but CFAA threats have been brought for
  violating use policies
- Example: LinkedIn vs HiQ
  - HiQ scrapes data from LinkedIn and uses it for analytics
  - Data comes from public profiles
    - Anyone can access this data, even without a LinkedIn account
** Cautionary Tale
- Kevin Finisterre identified several serious problems with DJI drones
  - Found SSL private keys and AES firmware encryption keys in DJI's public GitHub
  - Gained access to DJI servers containing customer data and business records
- DJI had a bug bounty program
  - Kevin disclosed his findings to DJI, did not go public
  - DJI agreed to 30k reward
- DJI demanded a restrictive NDA before paying the bounty
  - Kevin gave up the bounty and went public
- DJI overhauled their bug bounty terms
  - Gave people in the bug bounty program limited authorized access to their systems

* Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998
** Intentions
- Intended to criminalize circumvention of DRM
- Criminalizes circumvention of access controls
  - Whether or not you infringe copyrights
- Criminalizes distribution of circumvention tools
  - Whether or not you infringe copyrights
- Library of Congress may issue exemptions every 3 years
** Scope of the law:
- Copyright access control mechanisms include:
  - Encryption
  - Copy protection software and mechanisms
  - Watermarks
- Extremely broad scope
  - Any software can be copyrighted
  - Any encryption may be considered an access control mechanism
  - Authentication is also access control
** Current Exemptions:
- Good-faith research on
  - Consumer electronics and IoT devices
  - Medical devices
  - Voting machines
  - Jailbreaking and unlocking phones and digital assistants
- Exemptions are not permanent or all-inclusive
  - Must have legal access to the device or software
  - Cannot violate other laws, like the CFAA
** Takeaways
- If you are doing security research on a device you own, or software on a
  device in your possession, be careful of the DMCA
- If you are doing security research on a remote service via the internet, be
  careful of the DMCA and the CFAA
- Vulnerability research on companies without bug bounty programs is very risky,
  any even bug bounty programs do not guarantee zero risk
* CAN-SPAM act of 2003
Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act
** Main provisions:
- Email headers cannot be spoofed
- Email cannot be sent through open relays
- Email must contain a working unsubscribe option
- Email cannot be sent to a harvested email address
- Emails with explicit content must be prominently labeled
