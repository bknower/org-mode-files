#+TITLE: Access Control

* After Authentication, then what?

* Access control check
- Given an access request, return an access control decision

* Access control models
** Discretionary access control (DAC)
- Access rights propagate and may be changed at subject's discretion
- File has read/write privileges, and any user with those access rights can
  share them
- Users can pass on any priveleges they have
** Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Access of subjects to objects is based on a system-wide policy
- Users don't have full control over resources they create

* Methods of Access Control
** Access control matrices
- Read, write, excute permissions for every user for every object
- Difficult to control
- Too much to keep track of
** Unix-style permissions
- All objects have an owner and a group
- Permissions separated into owner, group, and everyone else
- Use chmod to edit permissions
- chmod +x :: makes a file executable
- chmod 777 :: 7 in binary is 111, setting read, write and execute each
  to 1; each 7 represents the permissions of the owner, the group, and everyone else
Who can change permissions?
- Only owner can change permissions and group
- Can only add a group you belong to
- Root can change permissions for any file


* Midterm Review:
- Security game for symmetric encryption
- Security game for Public Key Encryption
- Distributed password authentication
