#+TITLE: InterDomainRouting

* Network Layer, Control Plane
** Function
- Set up routes between networks
**

* AS numbers
** Each AS identifies by an ASN number
** Originally 16-bit values, expanded to 32 bits in 2006
** 1023 reserved for local/private use, 3 reserved for special use
** Currently, there are 65,539 advertised ASNs.

* Inter-Domain Routing
** Global connectivity at stake
*** All ASs must use the same protocol, in contrast with intra-domain routing
** Requirements
*** Scalability
*** Flexibility in choosing routes
**** Cost
**** Routing around failures
** BGP uses a path vector protocol, instead of distance vector or link state

* BGP :: Border Gateway Protocol
** Policy based routing protocol
** Uses a Bellman-Ford path vector protocol
** Simple protocol, but complex coniguration
** Entire world sees advertisements
*** Errors can screw up traffic globally
** Policies driven by economics, not performance

* BGP Relationships
** Customer pays provider
** Peers do not pay each other

* Peering :: provider routing traffic from another provider to a customer or vice versa
** Pros:
- Reduce upstream costs
- Improve end-to-end performance
- May be the only way to connect to some parts of the internet
** Cons:
- You would rather have customers
- Peers are often competitors
- Peering agreements require periodic renegotiation

* Two types of BGP Neighbors:
** iBGP :: Interior
*** Network core communicating
*** Prevents routing loops within the AS
*** OSPF does not include BGP policy info
** eBGP :: Exterior

* Path Vector Protocol
** AS-path :: sequence of ASs a route traverses
*** Similar to distance vector, but sends whole path
** Used for loop detection and to apply policy
*** If you see your own ID in an advertisement, discard it
** Default choice :: route with fewest # of ASs

* Types of BGP Messages:
** Open :: establish a peering connection
** Keep Alive: handshake at regular intervals
** Notification: shuts down a peering session
** Update: announce new routes or withdraw previously announced routes

* BGP Attributes
** Some attributes used to select "best" path
*** LocalPREF
**** Local preference policy to choose most preferred route
**** Overrides default fewest AS behavior
*** Multi-exit Discriminator (MED)
**** Chooses peering point for your network
**** Specifies path for external traffic destined for an internal network

* BGP session:
** Session connects 2 ASs
** Connected using TCP

* Importing routes
** From peer
** From customer
** From provider

* Exporting routes
** Share customers to peers
** Share customers to providers

* AS Relationships
** Each AS pair has exactly one relationship
** Each relationship is the same for all prefixes
** In Practice:
*** Widespread peering
*** Tier-1 ISPs being shoved out by huge content providers
*** BGP is insecure
