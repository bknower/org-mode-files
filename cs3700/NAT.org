#+TITLE: NAT

* IPv4 Shortage
- Problem: consumer ISPs typically only give 1 IP per household
- Idea: create a range of private IPs separate from the rest of the network
- Use a special router to bridge the LAN and WAN



* Basic NAT operation
- Special router at the boundary of a private network that translates addresses
  - Replaces internal IPs with external IP by modifying packet headers
  - May also replace TCP/UDP port numbers
  - Maintains a table of active flows
    - Outgoing packets initialize a table entry
    - Incoming packets are rewritten based on the table
    - Analogous to router forwarding table
- Creates (public address:port, private address:port) pairs
- A given private IP will get a particular port to send and receive from, and the router will translate messages at the public IP and that port to the private IP
- Properties of private IPs:
  - Not globally unique
  - Taken from non-routable IP ranges
   
* Advantages of NATs
- Multiple hosts can share a single IP
- Migration between ISPs is made easier
  - Even though the public IP changes, the router just reconfigures the translation table and hosts don't care
- Load
  - Router can forward traffic from a single public IP to multiple private hosts
- Natural firewall
  - Unless the sender has the right address and port, the packet gets blocked
  - If no port, the NAT tries to guess which one it should be. If it can't, it drops the packet

* Problems with NATs
- Performance and scalability issues
- Breaks layered network abstraction
- Breaks end-to-end Internet connectivity
  - 192.168.*.* addresses are private

* Port Forwarding
Private address accepts anything with the correct public IP and a given port

* Hole Punching
Problem: How to enable connectivity through NATs
** TURN
Traversal Using Relays around NAT
- Third party server displays forwarded ports between each
- Each side communicates first with server to establish connection, and then directly to each other
