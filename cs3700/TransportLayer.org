#+TITLE: TransportLayer

* Transport Layer
** Function:
- Demux of data streams
** Optional functions:
- Create long-lived connections
- Reliable, in-order packet delivery
- Error detection
- Flow and congestion control
** Key challenges:
- Detecting and responding to congestion
- Balancing fairness against high utilization

* Multiplexing
- No circuits
- No connections
- Clients run many applications at the same time
- Network layer needs to know what application to deliver to

* Demultiplexing:
- Network layer delivers packet to host
- Transport layer determines which application to deliver it to
- Based on IP tuple (src port, src IP, destination port, destination IP)

* UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Simple, connectionless datagram
- Header includes source port, destination port, payload length, checksum
- No flow control, in order delivery, reliability
- Invented after TCP
- Not all applications can tolerate TCP
  - Streaming
  - BitTorrent

* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
- Reliable, in-order, bi-directional byte streams
- Port numbers for demuxing
- Virtual circuits (connections)
- Flow control
- Congestion control

* TCP Connection Setup
- Establish state on both hosts
- Start with random sequence number
  - Avoid giving information on length of connection
  - Avoid predictable connections (more secure)
** 3-way handshake
1. Client sends SYN packet to server with sequence number
2. Server sends back SYN/ACK at same time with sequence number +1
3. Client ACKs server
** Problems:
- Packet injection
- Connection confusion
- Connection state management
  - SYN flood is common DOS attack

* TCP Connection Teardown
1. Either side can initiate
2. Send FIN packet
3. Receive ACK
4. Other side can continue sending data until sending FIN
5. ACK last FIN

* Sequence Number Space
- TCP uses a byte stream abstraction
  - Initial random values
  - Each byte numbered
  - 32-bit value, wraps around
- Byte stream broken down into segments (packets)
  - Sequence number increases for each packet

* Bidirectional Communication
- Each side of the connection can send and receive
