#+TITLE: IntraDomainRouting

* Network Layer, Control Plane
** Function:
*** Set up routes within a single network
** Key challenges:
*** Distributing and updating routes
*** Convergence time
*** Avoiding loops

* Internet Routing
Internet organized as a two-level hierarchy
** First level:
Autonomous Systems (AS's)
*** Region of network under a single administrative domain
*** Examples:
Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, etc.
*** AS's use intra-domain routing protocols internally
**** Distance Vector (RIP)
**** Link State (OSPF)
*** Connections between AS's use inter-domain routing protocols
**** Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
*** Why do we have AS's
**** Routing algorithms not efficient enough to work on the entire Internet
**** Different organizations may have different routing policies
Lowest cost vs. Fastest path
**** Organizations can hide their internal network structure
**** Organizations can choose how to route between each other
**** TL;DR
***** Easier to compute routes
***** More flexible
***** More autonomy

* Routing on a Graph
Goal: determine a "good" path through the network from source to destination
** What is a good path?
*** Shortest path
*** Load balanced
*** Lowest $$$ cost
** Network modeled as a graph
*** Routers are nodes
*** Links are edges

* Intra-domain routing protocols
** Link state
*** Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) based on Dijkstra
*** Each node periodically floods reachability information to all other routers
*** Each router locally computes full routes
** Distance vector
*** Routing Information Protocol (RIP) based on Bellman-Ford
*** Nodes periodically exchange reachability information with neighbors

* Link State Routing
** Each node knows its own connections and direct neighbor costs
** Each node tells other nodes this information
** All nodes come to know full network topology
** Flooding Details
*** Each node generates a Link State Packet (LSP)
**** ID of node that generated LSP
**** List of direct neighbors and costs
**** Sequence numbers
**** TTL
*** Flooding is reliable (ACK required, retransmit if not received)
*** Receivers send LSPs to their own neighbors except sender of LSP
*** LSPs also generated when Link State changes
** Use Dijkstra's algorithm for computing shortest paths
** 2 different implementations of Link State routing
*** OSPF
**** Favored by companies and datacenters
**** Simpler
**** More optional features
**** Built on top of IPv4
**** Organized around overlapping areas
***** Area 0 is the core network
*** IS-IS
**** Favored by ISPs
**** Less "chatty"
**** Less network overhead
**** More devices supported
**** Not tied to IP (works with IPv4 and IPv6)
**** Organized as a 2-level hierarchy
***** Level 2 is the backbone
